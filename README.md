# Attendance Checking Application Using Face Recognition

This project presents a real-time attendance system based on face recognition, designed to replace manual check-in processes in educational and organizational environments. The system leverages the face_recognition library built on top of dlib, which uses a pretrained ResNet-34 model to generate 128-dimensional face embeddings. Registered users capture their face images using a webcam, which are then stored and encoded. During operation, the system streams webcam video, detects faces using a HOG-based detector, and compares them against the known encodings using Euclidean distance. If a match is found below a defined threshold (0.45), the user is marked present and a confirmation email is sent using Flask-Mail. The application runs on a lightweight Flask web interface, offering features such as real-time attendance display and history search by name. This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and machine learning in automating routine administrative tasks with high accuracy, efficiency, and usability.
